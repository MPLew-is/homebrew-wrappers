# Homebrew Wrappers #

This repository is [a Homebrew Tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) containing Homebrew installation wrappers for other people's software that don't have Homebrew formulae/cask definitions already written for them.
This repository is also occasionally used to re-host published binaries/packages that have disappeared from their original locations, such as [the `avibrazil-rdm` Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/138247) that has been abandoned but is still perfectly functional.
